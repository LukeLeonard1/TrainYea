# TrainYea

Tain Yea is a hackathon project that won the CTA award of the Demon Hacks. The project was made by 4 studtens going to Illinois Institute of Technology where the name comes from a saying at the school "Tec yeah". 

The project's goal is to simulate the live goings of a public CTA train being used heavily, and our goal was to spread people around the train better with Covid. We did this by simulating data of a weight sensor that would be added to the bottoms of trains that calculate how many people are in each cart. The sensors sends the data to a API which we then display a graphic on screen at the station showing different colors for each cart status. The random data changes on the fly as needed and shows how this would disperse people amoungs the train evenly by displaying the data on the screens at the stations. 

The simulated live data from a script to API to graphic display won the CTA award at the demon hacks.
